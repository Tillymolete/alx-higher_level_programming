This is a python if/else, loop, function task

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

1. The last digit
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

You can find the source code here
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what import, random.randint do. Please do not touch this code. This line should not change: number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
the number, followed by
the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

5. 00...99
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

7. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

10. a + b
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11. a ^ b
Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

12. Fizz Buzz
Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

13. Insert in sorted linked list
Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

Prototype: listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);
Return: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
