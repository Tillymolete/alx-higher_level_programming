This is a readme file for python's data structures, list adn tuples

0. Print a list of integers
This will write a function that prints all integers of a list.

1. Secure access to an element in a list
This will write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

2. Replace element
This will write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
This will write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

4. Replace in a copy
This will write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

5. Can you C me now?
This will write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

6. Lists of lists = Matrix
This will write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

7. Tuples addition
This will write a function that adds 2 tuples.

8. More returns!
This will write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

9. Find the max
This will write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

10. Only by 2
This will write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

11. Delete at
This will write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

12. Switch
This will complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b

13. Linked list palindrome
This will a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

14. CPython #0: Python lists
This will create a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
